Our climate is bonkers. If we are to mitigate the worst 
impacts of runaway climate change, we must all get our sh#t together 
and drastically reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.
<br>
<br>
How, you ask? It's complicated. 
We emit greenhouse gases in virtually every aspect of modern life. 
The best way to both understand and track where these emissions are coming from 
is through data. Reliable, clean, easily accesible, free, and comprehensive data. 
And that is what Greenhouse Data offers: a user-friendly repository of 
various greenhouse gas emission inventories (and lots of pre-made figures) 
for all countries of the world.
<br>
<br>
This project was inspired by my masters thesis written at ETH Zurich titled "A comparative analysis of various greenhouse gas emission inventories, & exploring the public's perception on the relationship between plastics and climate change" (supervised by my awesome mentors Sonia Seneviratne, Jonas Schwabb and Anthony Patt). I couldn't stand the thought of my masters thesis being burried deep within the Realms of The Forgotten Theses. So I made this.

Contact me at dquintani at student.ethz.ch, or feel free to clone the project & create pull requests. If you manage to understand the [messy] project code, then you too cAN easily & rapidly create and add a GHG emission figure for all countries of the world using either "Graphs" .ipynb notebook in the scripts folder.
